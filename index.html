    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how BioBit (Private) Limited (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
      stores, and protects personal information in connection with the Connecto mobile application and its related
      services (the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and
      agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is intended solely for individuals who are at least sixteen (16) years of age. By using the Service,
      you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. The Company does not knowingly collect or process
      personal data from individuals under the age of sixteen.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The Company collects only the information that is reasonably necessary to operate, maintain and secure the
      Service. This may include basic account details such as an email address, username and profile photograph,
      content voluntarily submitted by users including posts, images, comments and profile information, as well as
      communications exchanged through private or group messaging features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where applicable, verification related information may be collected, including documents submitted manually or
      institutional or work email addresses used for authentication purposes. Such verification data is used strictly
      to confirm eligibility or authenticity and is not used for marketing, profiling or advertising purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service may also collect limited technical or usage-related data through internal analytics in order to
      monitor performance, improve reliability and ensure system security. All such data is stored using reputable
      and secure database infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      Collected information is used exclusively for legitimate operational purposes. These purposes include creating
      and managing user accounts, enabling core social networking functionality, maintaining platform security,
      preventing fraud or abuse, improving service performance, and responding to user inquiries or support requests.
      The Company does not sell, rent, or trade personal data under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All personal data is stored on secure systems controlled by the Company or its trusted infrastructure providers.
      Access to such data is restricted to authorized personnel only and is protected through reasonable technical and
      organizational safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
    </p>

    <h2>Message Privacy and Exceptional Access</h2>
    <p>
      Private messages exchanged through the Service are not routinely monitored or reviewed by the Company.
      Exceptional access to such communications may occur only where a user explicitly requests assistance, where
      required by applicable law or where necessary to address safety concerns or resolve disputes. Any such access
      is limited, logged and conducted solely for compliance or protective purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Users may delete their content, including posts, comments, images and messages at any time through the
      Service. Once deleted, such content is permanently removed from active databases and is no longer accessible
      through the platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      The Company does not share personal information with third parties, advertisers or external organizations.
      All user data remains within systems controlled by the Company and is used solely in accordance with this
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Public Profiles</h2>
    <p>
      User profiles and content are public by default. Information and content shared publicly may be viewed by other
      users of the Service. Users are responsible for the content they choose to make public.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
